## Evelynn — 3v3lynn

I build things that work, feel intentional, and are meant to last.  
Full Stack Developer & Cybersecurity student.

My focus is on web development, automation, and small systems where structure and clarity matter as much as functionality.

I value simplicity, purpose, and learning through building.
